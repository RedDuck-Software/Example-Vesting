# Vesting contracts repository

This is the repository containing contracts source and tests for the article where we described different types of Vestings, their cons and pros: <Link to the article>

If you want to play with the code, you can try running following commands:
1. Npm i
2. Npx hardhat compile
3. Npx hardhat test

If you get an error "error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported", it means that you have a node version higher than 16. You should install a lesser version, for instance 16.15.1 (nvm use v16.15.1 if you have nvm)

If you get other errors, you can contact me by email: mark.virchenko@redduck.io and let me know about those errors.
